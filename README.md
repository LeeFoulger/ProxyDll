# ProxyDll
 - A simple d3dx9_43 proxy with plugin manager.

# Notes
 - The ms23 project will only work for **Halo Online (1.106708 2015-03-20)** the initial leak and only with ElDorito (any version) or ElDewrito (version 0.5.x or less) this is required for the game to run.

# TODO
 - Possibly add each specific hook/patch to the config and check before apply, since we have a string for them all
 - Add exports for game version and load only the dlls that are specific to that version.
