# ProxyDll
 - A simple d3dx9_43 proxy with plugin manager.

# Notes
 - The ms23 project will only work for **Halo Online (1.106708 2015-03-20)** the initial leak and only with ElDorito (any version) or ElDewrito (version 0.5.x or less) this is required for the game to run.

# TODO
 - Possibly not require ElDorito/ElDewrito to run, this would mean adding the basic hooks/patches.
  - This would be a waste of time and effort that could be spent on improving the overall codebase.
